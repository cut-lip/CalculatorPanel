# Welcome to CalculatorPanel

### Have you ever wanted a really basic GUI based calculator that you can run from the command with naught but a simple Java file? Look no further.

##### Rules are as follows:
If you wish to use a decimal point to represent a value less than 1,
the preceding zero will be automatically provided for you. ( . -> 0. )

For functions and exponent (i.e. sin, cos, tan, cot, ln, log, ^) an opening parenthesis will be provided
for the user. It is the users responsibility to close the set: i.e. "cos (" 

Empty sets of parenthesis or brackets will be automatically removed upon input: i.e. () or {}

Trigonometric functions are evaluated in radians.

A multiplication operator (*) will be automatically placed after a closing parenthesis and before a digit or an opening parenthesis, if omitted by user.
